# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to  provide evidence of academic dishonesty in the reading and math scores for ninth graders in Thomas High School. To uphold the state-testing standards, we will be replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs. Lastly, we will rerun our analysis to see if there were any changes in the output for our key metrics that would affect our overall analysis. 

## Results:

### District Summary

1) The difference between the district summary output before and after replacing the ninth grade math and reading scores was very minimal. The % Passing Math was 0.2% lower in the clean student data vs the original district summary. The % Passing Reading was 0.1% lower in the clean student data vs the original district summary. Lastly, the % Overall Passing was 0.3% lower in the clean student data vs the original district summary. Given that all variances are less than 1% it proves that the clean student data did not have a large effect on the overall outcome.
