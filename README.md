# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to  provide evidence of academic dishonesty in the reading and math scores for ninth graders in Thomas High School. To uphold the state-testing standards, we will be replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs. Lastly, we will rerun our analysis to see if there were any changes in the output for our key metrics that would affect our overall analysis. 

## Results:

### District Summary
